# React Native Multiple RCTRootView

[![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chicio/React-Native-Multiple-RCTRootView/master/LICENSE.md)

An example project in which I show how it is possible to use multiple instances of `RCTRootView` in an existing iOS app integrated with React Native. This example has been created for my blog post  [React Native: use multiple RTCRootView instances in an existing iOS app](https://www.fabrizioduroni.it/2017/12/08/react-native-multiple-instance-rctrootview/ "React Native: use multiple RTCRootView instances in an existing iOS app").

### Description

This repository contains an example of an existing app in which React Native has been added and is used to show multiple RCTRootView to display different React Native components in different parts of the app. Below an article quote:

> If we want to start to use React Native in an existing app, it's really easy. We can have our first React
Native component live inside our app by just following the getting started tutorial for existing app. But what
happen if we need to use multiple react native component in different parts of your existing app :fearful:? In this
tutorial I will show you how you can use multiple instances of  `RCTRootView` to show different React Native components
in different parts of your app.
